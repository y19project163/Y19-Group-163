      Future network with smart Internet of Things (IoT) by device identification have taken a giant leap 
in cloud due to proliferate data demands, Internet-enabled services, and burgeoning
network traffic in the cloud. Hence, type of heterogenous IoT device is to be recognised/ identified 
by machine learning algorithms such as classification, regression, clustering, and association.
      IoT-Cloud, a platform to connect smart devices to cloud services for real time data processing 
and control. A device connected to IoT-Cloud can communicate with real time devices for data 
analysis. A framework to be deployed in the cloud by ML to identify heterogenous IoT device 
by its speed of data transfer, protocol, and the data transfer format. The platform design is scalable 
in connecting devices as well as transferring and processing data.
      In addition, Security and vulnerability is also predicted by data interaction format in the cloud environment.
